Run `npm install` to install packages
Run `ng serve` to start project
Project will run on `http://localhost:4200/`

Initially, the project includes mock data, which will be updated based on user interactions. However, if the app is reloaded, everything will revert to its initial state.

Key features as per requirements:

- Room statuses change color (Green: Available, Orange: Cleaning, Red: Occupied) and can be quickly updated using the row actions.
- Rooms can be edited and deleted.
- The table includes sorting functionality and a search input for finding any field.
- The form for editing and adding new rooms uses Reactive Forms.
- Two custom pipes are included in the shared module.
- NgXs state management is implemented.

I hope this project meets your expectations. Greetings!
